<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>World Wide Web</b>
<p>The World Wide Web is a huge collection of <em>HTML documents</em>. It was invented in the 1990s and now it contains over 30 billion <em>web pages</em>.</p>
<p>This is how it works. When you visit a web page your computer sends a <em>HTTP request</em>  to a <em>server</em>  via  <em> the Internet</em>. The server finds the HTML document with all the files for the page and sends it back to your computer.  The <em>browser</em> on your computer interprets the information sent by the server and shows you the web page.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=13&v=kzyfIiVZPJA"> Here</a> is a good video about the components of the web.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) is a special code for computers. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> (what you actually see on the page) and <em>markup</em> (how the content is arranged).</p>

<b>Tags</b>
<p>HTML markup is made of different <em>tags</em>. Together with content they make up different types of <em>elements</em>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444"> Here </a>is a video about structure of HTML documents. </p>
<p>Tags are essential and you should be very carefull when writing HTML because computers are "stupid". Tags are instructions for them so even a smallest mistake can lead to a big problem.</p>
